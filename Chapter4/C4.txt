1. What is [] ?

   Ans:   [] refers to an empty list

2. How would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value in a list stored
in a variable named spam ? (Assume spam contains [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] .)

  Ans :  spam[2]='hello'

3.
  For the following three questions, let’s say spam contains the list ['a',
'b', 'c', 'd']

  Ans: '3'*2=33
       int(33/11)=3
       spam[int('3'*2)/11]=3
       spam[3]=d

4.What does spam[-1] evaluate to?

  Ans:    [-1] refers to the last index and spam[-1]='d'


5.What does spam[:2] evaluate to?       

  Ans:    ['a','b']

For the following three questions, let’s say bacon contains the list
[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True] .

6. What does bacon.index('cat') evaluate to?


  Ans :   1

7  What does bacon.append(99) make the list value in bacon look like?
 
  Ans: [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True , 99] .


8. What does bacon.remove('cat') make the list value in bacon look like?

  Ans : [3.14,  11, 'cat', True , 99]

9.What are the operators for list concatenation and list replication?

 Ans : list concatenation operator :  +
       list replication opertor  : *

10 .What is the difference between the append() and insert() list methods?

 Ans : append() method call adds an argument to the end of the list ,
 while insert() will insert a value at any index on the list

11.What are two ways to remove values from a list?
 Ans: using  remove() method and del statement

12. Name a few ways that list values are similar to string values.

*Like lists indexing , slicing are possible for strings too
*Like lists strings can also be used
      *with for loops
      *with len()
      *with in and not in operators 
       
13.What is the difference between lists and tuples?

    * lists are typed with brackets whereas tuples are typed with paranthesis
    * lists are mutable whereas tuples are immutable
    
14. How do you type the tuple value that has just the integer value 42 in it?  

Ans : (42,)

15. How can you get the tuple form of a list value? How can you get the list
form of a tuple value?

Ans: functions list() and tuple() will return list and tuple versionsof the values passed to them. 
 tuple form of a list value : tuple([])
 list form of tuple value :  list (())

16.Variables that “contain” list values don’t actually contain lists directly.
What do they contain instead?

Ans : variables store references to list

17.What is the difference between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy() ?
 Ans : copy.deepcopy() does not make any changes to original object but copy.copy changes the original object
